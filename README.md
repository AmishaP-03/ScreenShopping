# Authentication

1. Implement a multi-step form for a signup process using HTML and CSS. 
2. The form should:
-> include steps for personal details, contact information, and password creation.
-> show a progress bar indicating the current step.
-> perform client-side validation before moving to the next step (e.g., email format, password strength).
-> Use CSS for styling and transitions between form steps.

# Home page

1. Create a navbar with a cart icon on the top right corner showing the count of items currently in cart
2. Create a responsive gallery of products using CSS grid.
3. This gallery would consist of interactive product cards, built using HTML and CSS that includes:
-> An image of the product.
-> Product details like name, price, and a short description.
-> Animated buttons for adding the product to a cart.
4. When an image/card is clicked
-> Open a modal window displaying the image in a larger view with additional information (e.g., title, description).
-> Include navigation controls in the modal to move to the next or previous card.
-> Ensure the modal is accessible, with the ability to close it using a button or the Escape key.
